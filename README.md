===========

This is a hire board for DevMountain students. Meanstack App (Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB)

I am trying to use this pluggin to handle thumbnails: https://github.com/panta/mongoose-thumbnail

It goes in conjunction with https://github.com/panta/mongoose-file

If this plugin does not work, then would GridFS for Mongodb work? Also, how to do link object in mongodb. Is that what "metadata" does in mongodb?

Thanks for the help.
